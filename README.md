# Insta-Toggle-VPN

Sometimes, Instagram prevents login to your account because it dislikes your actual VPN server.   
This script allows to temporarily toggle (30 s.) from one Mullvad server to another with a countdown. Just long enough to sign up to your acccount.

Assigning a shortcut like < Super + I > to the script is a good tip to run it and toggle server. With a command like:   
`sh -c ~/instagram_tmp-toggle-vpnserver.sh`
